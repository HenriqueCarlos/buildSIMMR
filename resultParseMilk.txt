Original Texts: 
3 pounds ground beef
17 saltine crackers, finely crushed
1/2 cup milk
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch salt, or to taste
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups water
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed beef and mushroom soup
1 (.75 ounce) packet dry brown gravy mix
In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, saltine crackers and milk. 
Season with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper, and mix until well blended. 
Line a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan with waxed paper. 
Press the beef mixture firmly into the pan. 
Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 8 to 10 hours, or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
Remove plastic wrap from meat, and rub flour over the top side of the beef. 
Flip out of the pan onto waxed paper, and rub flour on the other side as well. 
Cut into pieces (I use a pizza cutter).
Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. 
Fry the meat until browned on each side, turning only once. 
Remove to a 9x13 inch baking dish. 
In a medium bowl, mix together the water, condensed soup, and gravy mix. 
Pour over the meat in the dish. 
Cover the dish loosely with aluminum foil.

Original Texts: 
3/4 cup cake flour
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
5 tablespoons shortening
1 egg yolk
2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar
3 cubes  ice
1/2 cup cold water
Measure butter and shortening onto a plate, put into freezer for about 20 minutes.
Measure cake flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, salt and baking powder into the bowl of a food processor.  
Pulse for a few seconds to mix.
Take 1/2 of the cold butter and 1/2 of the cold shortening, put into processor with dry ingredients and pulse off and on for about 1 minute.
Scrape down twice while doing this.
Take remainder of the cold butter and cold shortening and cut in very briefly with the processor, leaving visible pea-sized chunks.  
In a measuring cup, mix egg yolk and vinegar together, add ice cubes and water.  
Let this get chilled, about 3 to 4 minutes.
Remove mixed flours and shortening from processor, put into a large mixing bowl.  
Sprinkle approximately 4 to 5 tablespoons of this egg, water, vinegar mixture, a little at a time, mixing gently with a fork. 
The key to this is, you do not want a wet dough, and you do not want to overmix.
Place this dough into plastic wrap or plastic bag, chill in refrigerator for a few minutes. 
Remove from refrigerator and roll out.

1/2 cup warm water
3 1/2 cups unbleached bread flour

       11  "carved lamb"

Original Texts: 
1/4 cup olive oil
8 cloves garlic, minced
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 (8 pound) leg of lamb, boned and butterflied to a more or less even thickness, 4 3/4 to 5 1/2 pounds trimmed weight, fell and most fat removed
1 lemon, juiced
Minced fresh parsley, cilantro or mint  (optional)
Mix oil, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin and oregano; spread paste on both sides of the lamb and let stand for an hour until meat comes to room temperature.
Adjust oven rack to upper or upper-middle position (depending on lamb's thickness) and preheat broiler on high for at least 10 minutes.
Place lamb, cut side up, on a large wire rack set over a foil-lined roasting pan. 
Broil, moving pan so entire surface browns evenly, about 8 minutes. 
Turn lamb over; continue to broil until well browned on the other side, about 8 minutes longer. 
Turn off broiler, remove lamb from oven and let rest for 10 minutes.
Heat oven to 325 degrees. 
Stick a meat thermometer into the thickest portion of the lamb; return it to the oven. 
Roast for a total of 50 minutes to 1 hour, until thermometer registers a rosy-pink 140 degrees. 
Check lamb several times after 30 minutes. 
If lamb gets done sooner, simply turn down oven to 170 degrees until ready to serve.
As soon as lamb comes out of the oven, squeeze on lemon juice and sprinkle with fresh herbs. 
Carve, slicing across the grain when possible. 
Arrange on a platter, drizzle with accumulated juices, and serve.

1 tablespoon olive oil
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1/2 cup white wine
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Slice the top of the head of garlic, just enough to remove paper and expose the tops of the cloves. 
Drizzle with olive oil and roast in preheated oven, either in a clay garlic roaster or wrapped in aluminum foil. 
Roast for 20 minutes or until cloves are soft and slip from skins when pushed. 
Change oven setting to broil (375 degrees F, 190 degrees C). 
Let garlic cool.
To prepare chicken, place in a 9x13 inch baking dish and splash both sides with white wine. 
Broil for 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
Meanwhile, place butter or margarine and milk in a large skillet and heat over medium heat until warm. 
Stir in the flour and cheese. 
Stir over medium heat until sauce begins to thicken. 
Slip cooled garlic cloves from skin and add to the sauce (if desired, mince first). 
Add chopped parsley. 
Bring nearly to a boil; reduce heat and stir to control thickening. 
If desired, pour sauce over cooked rice or pasta and top with broiled chicken. 
Enjoy!

1/2 cup ketchup
4 tablespoons unsweetened pineapple juice
4 tablespoons molasses
2 tablespoons dark rum
2 tablespoons prepared Dijon-style mustard
2 cloves garlic, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
8 chicken thighs
To Make Glaze: In a medium bowl combine the ketchup, pineapple juice, molasses, rum, mustard and garlic. 
Season with salt and pepper to taste and mix well.
Place chicken pieces in a lightly oiled 9x13 inch baking dish; brush both sides with prepared glaze, using about 1/2 of the glaze. 
Cover dish and refrigerate to marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight. 
Also, refrigerate remaining glaze.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Lightly brush chicken pieces on one side with some of the reserved glaze and bake uncovered in preheated oven for about 25 minutes. 
Turn pieces, brush with remaining glaze and bake for another 25 minutes or until chicken is tender.
Preheat oven to broil.
Put chicken under broiler and lightly brown on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes each side. 
(Note: Watch chicken carefully, as this 'sugary' glaze burns easily!)

Original Texts: 
1 1/3 cups yellow mustard
2 (1 ounce) envelopes dry onion soup mix
1 (5 pound) beef rump roast
In a small bowl, mix together the mustard and onion soup mix. 
Lay out two long sheets of aluminum foil crosswise. 
Pat the roast dry, and place in the center of the foil. 
Generously coat the roast with the mustard mixture. 
Wrap the foil tightly around the roast, then apply one more piece of foil to really seal it in so that the roast can be rotated without all of the juices spilling out. 
Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect heat. 
For charcoal, light the coals, then move to one side of the grill. 
Place the roast on the grill, and cover. 
Cook for about 2 hours, turning every 30 to 45 minutes, or until the internal temperature is at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). 
Let stand for about 10 minutes before carving. 
Place on a deep serving plate before unwrapping so you can be sure to save the juices and mustard rub to slather on the beef slices.

1 egg
1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon orange flower water
4 cups raw almonds
1 cup sugar
3 eggs
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla powder
1 lemon, zested
cornstarch, for rolling out the dough
pine nuts, for decoration
Bring 6 cups of water to a boil. 
Remove from heat, and add the almonds. 
Let the almonds soak in water for about 5 minutes, then drain and peel. 
Spread the almonds on baking sheets, and bake at 200 degrees F(95 degrees C) until completely dry and toasted. 
This takes several hours, and needs to be prepared ahead. 
Be careful not to burn the nuts, as this will give a bitter taste to the filling. 
Combine 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. 
Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice, reduce heat to low, and let it simmer until syrupy, about 30 to 40 minutes. 
Stir in orange blossom water, and remove from heat. 
Set sugar syrup aside. 
Combine flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. 
Make a hole in the center, and pour oil, egg, 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon orange blossom water into the center. 
Mix with fingers until the dough resembles coarse crumbs. 
Gradually sprinkle with warm water while mixing until the dough becomes soft and pliable. 
Divide into 4 equal portions. 
Cover dough with a wet cloth, and set aside. 
In a food processor, finely grind the almonds. 
Measure 3 cups of the finely ground almonds into a mixing bowl, and stir together with 1 cup sugar, baking powder, vanilla powder, lemon zest, and 2 tablespoons orange flower water. 
Mix in three eggs one at a time, stirring constantly; mix until you get a sticky, paste-like mixture. 
Sprinkle cornstarch on the rolling surface to prevent sticking. 
Roll each portion of dough very thinly, 1 to 2 millimeters (1/16 inch). 
Cut the rolled dough into circles of about 10 centimeters (4 inches) in diameter each. 
Lightly wipe the surface of each circle with cornstarch, and fit into a tart mold, cornstarch side down to prevent sticking. 
Gently press the dough onto the sides and bottom of the mold, and trim extra dough from around the rim. 
Fill three quarters of each mold with the almond filling. 
Bake on the top shelf at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the surface of the tart is golden and the dough is firm. 
Remove the tarts from the molds as soon as they come out of the oven. 
Dip each tart in the sugar syrup while still hot. 
Stick a pine nut into the middle of each tart for decoration. 
Place on a wire rack to drain.

1 pint heavy cream
6 kiwi, peeled and sliced
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).

Original Texts: 
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
12 small chile peppers, diced  (optional)
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1/2 pint heavy cream
6 (6 inch) corn tortillas
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (10 ounce) can enchilada sauce
Cut chicken breasts into 1 inch strips. 
Place in a medium bowl with desired marinade, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
Saute chicken and onions until chicken is evenly brown. 
Stir in diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, stewed tomatoes, chile peppers, soup and broth. 
Bring mixture to a boil. 
Reduce heat, cover skillet, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. 
Remove chicken from skillet, and shred when cool enough to handle. 
Meanwhile, allow skillet mixture to simmer and reduce to about 2 1/4 cups. 
In a medium bowl, combine shredded chicken and about 1/4 cup skillet mixture (just enough to make a paste like mixture). 
Mix together with half the chopped green onions. 
Pour remaining 2 cups of skillet mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. 
In a second skillet, heat cream over low heat, being careful not to boil. 
Dip tortillas in the warm cream to soften and coat. 
Spoon about 1/3 cup chicken mixture onto each tortilla. 
Top chicken mixture with half the shredded cheese, and roll up tortillas. 
Place rolled tortillas in baking dish, seam side down, and drizzle with enchilada sauce. 
Cover with remaining shredded cheese, and sprinkle remaining chopped green onion over cheese. 
Bake uncovered in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbling.

1 orange, sliced into rounds
1 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup orange juice
1 (10.5 ounce) can chicken broth
